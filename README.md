# About the project

Soliter (name stil in the works) is a simple scrappe-to-epub app made mostly to get better working with React and to learn some Flask.
It allows you to simply post a bunch of links to nosleep / writing prompts post from reddit and have it all put into a giant epub to read on the go.
Heavily inspired by H.P Lovecrafts H.P Lovecraft: The Complete Fiction.

All the informations about the author, original link and all the rights to the story ARE included in the final epub - usually at the end of the book.
